# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Jimmy Zhen.I am a college student who majors in software-engineering.
I love listenning to music,watching TV series,reading books and playing vedio games.
My dream is to start a group that makes the most touching vedio games in the world.
I believe that games can be a kind of culture changing people's opinion about the world.
Games can be a window for people to experience things they might not have experienced before.
